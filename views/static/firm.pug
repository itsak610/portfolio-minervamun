            | Minerva Model UN is an emerging foundation which has its roots in the vision of some students from grades 11 and 12. This chapter, very much like the previous one is an Online conference, keeping in mind the current situation around the globe. To recapitulate things, the first chapter was a grand success for all of us with the participation of over 200 delegates from India as well as many other countries and building upon that, we are expecting over 500 delegates for the Second chapter.

            |  Inspired by the Atmanirbhar approach introduced by our government, we too have developed our strategies and ideologies. We host committees of a great spectrum ranging from a future crisis like dealing with the galactic federation to the past like the Reagan Administration idea of Star Wars, we also support human rights of prisoners that are being violated to a high extent by a lot of countries in the contemporary world and we also are revisiting the Indian elections of 2019 to develop the spirit of a true politician amongst the delegates and we also have a journalists committee, that is to support the fourth pillar of democracy.
